Design of the Abatron 803 calculator in css. I thought the calculator was really pretty, so wanted to recreate the design in HTML/CSS.

It's not functional at this point, but I might add some JavaScript to make it work like a real calculator as well.

**The result**

**Important to note**
This is the Abatron 803 from 1976: https://www.calculator.org/calculators/Abatron_803.html

The original image I stumbled upon (which I thought was a real calculator too) and inspired my design by turned out to be a photoshop creation by https://dribbble.com/shots/499001-Abatron-Calculator-Buttons. That design was an interpretation of a real calculator from 1975, called the Abatron 803. 

However, I have since edited my design (fonts, colors, sizing, spacing, patterns) to reflect the design of the real Abatron 803.
